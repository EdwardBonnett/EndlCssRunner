# EndlCssRunner
An endless runner game made in pure CSS and HTML, no Javascript at all. The project weighs in at under 10kb thanks to gzip and has offline support thanks to appcache.

# CSS Animations
This project was designed to test CSS animations to the limit, and to see what was now possible using pure CSS. Turns out you can do quite a lot if you use a few tricks. This endless runner could definitely be made better using a little bit of JavaScript (the controls in particular could do with some improvements), but I wanted to keep this as pure CSS.
